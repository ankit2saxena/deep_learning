### Prediction of personality traits based on facial features extracted from videos using Deep Learning

“According to psychology researchers, the first impressions are formed in limited exposure (100ms) to unfamiliar faces.” [1]. But can an AI predict apparent personality traits of an individual given a short video?

During interviews, the mindset or perception of the interviewer can affect the selection of an individual. It is possible for machine learning models to classify the personality traits of an individual based on facial expressions, body language, or speech of the individual in the video. One of the most commonly used personality model is the Big-Five model which rates the five traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN) [2].

The model generated here is trained and evaluated on YouTube videos provided by ChaLearn LAP APA2016 dataset [3]. 
It achieves excellent performance and is able to outperform the top teams from the competition on two categories: Openness, and Conscientiousness.
